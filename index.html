            <p>Koch School is an International School in Aarhus. The School offers children of all nationalities the opportunity to be creative and innovative. The School focuses on integrating cultures as a part of the learning environment, introducing the children to many different cultures, an ability which will benefit and prepare them in the global society that we live today.</p>

        <p>Our children and we are part of a society and we wish that their schools fulfill the diversity that can be found in ethnicities, cultures and so on. The pupils of Kochs School come from a wide range of different cultures and we strive to involve the opportunities and resources that lie in diversity.</p>

        <p>It is important that all of our pupils receive a cultural understanding. To understand cultural differences as well as similarities. It is for this reason we greatly strive for integration between the Danish and international pupils to pursue our goal of cultural understanding.</p>

        <p>Kochs School has received positive response from parents, who value the cultural meetings between pupils.</p>

        <br>
        <div class="quote">
        <p>"It is important for us, that our children learn both English and Danish on a high level. English because we live an international life, where we move frequently and do not know how long we will be staying in Denmark. Danish because we live in Denmark and think that it is important to speak the language and know about the culture of the country. We will not limit our childrens' social circle, just because they do not talk Danish. If they are raised with both Danish and English, they have more opportunites and when they have to choose an education or a career later on in their lives."

        <p>The cultural encounter and cooperation across nationalities and languages become a recurrent theme. It has not been seen in Aarhus before, that there is a bilingual school, where the international pupils receive teaching in both Danish and English. Kochs School sees it as an advantage being able to speak a language in common. It can contribute to more interaction and integration into the Danish society.</p>

            "We wish that [the children] receive many opportunities for their future, but also create friendships for life and that they have good experiences together with their friends. It is important for us that they don't only just learn something academically but can also think for themselves and be able to decide independently."
